# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Faris Allaf, also known as @TheDarkNight21

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where you'll find a blend of AI-driven innovation, cutting-edge algorithms, and creative tech solutions.

## ðŸ‘€ About Me
Iâ€™m passionate about the intersection of AI, finance, and technology. As a third-year Computer Science student, Iâ€™m constantly exploring ways to push boundaries with code and algorithms, especially in the fields of automation and financial technology. I love taking on projects that challenge me to learn new things, whether it's building AI solutions, improving the efficiency of businesses through automation, or developing powerful iOS apps.

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Learning
I'm currently diving deeper into:
- **Regex pattern matching**: Expanding my pattern recognition skills through projects like building my own grep tool.
- **Stock and crypto trading algorithms**: Developing an AI bot called *Khalid Ibn Al Walid* that analyzes cryptocurrency data and automates trading strategies.
- **iOS app development**: Following tutorials on Firebase, iOS SDK, and more to create seamless, powerful mobile apps.
- **Artificial intelligence in marketing**: I'm building a comprehensive deck titled "AI: Revolutionizing Modern Marketing" to showcase AI's impact on digital marketing.

## ðŸ’» Projects & Collaboration
- **Educational AI**: I'm developing an AI-based platform aimed at teaching college students of Arab descent how to read and write in formal Arabic (Fusha).
- **Open-Source Contributions**: Always looking to contribute to exciting open-source projects, particularly in AI, finance, and software development.

If you're interested in collaborating on AI, algorithms, or even creating the next big thing in app development, feel free to reach out!

## âš¡ Fun Fact
When I'm not coding or working on my next big idea, you'll find me working out daily while managing Type 1 Diabetes. Iâ€™ve turned that challenge into motivation to keep pushing myself to new heights, just like I do in my projects!

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore my repositories!
